        #Git status         (shows the current state of your working directory)
        #Git add -A         (stages all changes (new, modified, and deleted files) in your 
                                working directory for the next commit.)
        #Git status         (again shows the current state of your working directory)
        #Git commit -m "Your commit message"    (creates a new commit with the staged changes)
        #Git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git (paste the origin given in the github repository)
